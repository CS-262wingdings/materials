Usability test:
------
Intro:
--------
Thanks for agreeing to do this usability test for our app! It's called Pigeon Poll, and we'd like to see first hand what it's like for non-developers to use the app.

We are not testing you, we're testing the app. You literally cannot do anything incorrectly - if you can't figure out the app, it's our fault. Don't be afraid to give us your own critiques!

We will be asking you to do different things with the app. Think out loud, tell us the things you see and do. Give us your questions and comments. We'll write them down, but we won't make them public. If, for any reason, you'd like to quit, just say so.

Background questions
---------
Have you ever played a party game with a cell phone? Have you ever played a party game with a TV or computer?

Do you have any questions for us?

TEST
---------
(give phone, show game icon)
1. Start it up, and tell us what you think.

2. Start a new game.

(players should be seated in a circle around them, game should start eventually)

3. (After a few rounds) Go back to the main menu.

4. Make your own question. Upload it to the internet too.

5. Try to download a question from the internet.

6. Final observations - do you have any observations about the app? Would you consider using it?

Thanks for testing our app! It's still in development, so we appreciate your help in adding polish and fixes. We will keep the data from this session private, but just between you and me, I had a great time.
