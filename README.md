 # PIGEON POLL
 
Pidgeon poll is a new Android game where players pass around a phone and ask questions about each other and answer anonymously. Then, players have to find out who got the most votes. 
 
Pigeon Poll is a party game for groups of three or more that is socially engaging, intuitive,
 and requires little setup. While other party games might require each player to have a phone,
 our game only needs one device.
 
As a player, you are tasked with gauging the opinion of your opponents using body language, inside knowledge, and reverse psychology. Do you know your friends better than they know themselves?
